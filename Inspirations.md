# Inspiration sites for BeautiControl Re-Design

1. Mary Kay
     - Nav bar at the top is clear and easy to see.
     - White background is welcoming and a good canvas for other colors.
     - Very wordy in some of the specific sections.
     - Random pic on nav bar, not sure why it is there.
     - Carousel slider is first thing users see, does not move on it's own. 
     - Very small type on footer. Words may be hard for some to see. Gray also maybe not best color choice, bleeds into white canvas background.
     - Charity section is lumped in with products. It should maybe be moved elsewhere.

2. Aloette
     - Nav bar at top, clean and organized. Easy for people to navigate.
     - Picture at top may not be necessary, but also very big.
     - Handbag icon great instead of shopping cart. Unique and easy to understand purpose.
     - Following sections are very good. Clear and precise. Are good at getting to the point without too many words.
     - Hierarchy not great for defining the sections, and the sections are very big.
     - Sections should be clickable. 
     - Showing team members is great way to personalize the site and experience.

3. Avon
     - Nav bar at top, good location. 
     - Hover on picture to see the price. That is very effective. Shows that it is clickable and will take you to the correct spot for purchase. 
     - Maybe should not mix in random pictures with the clickable, shopping pics however. Also this feature might be better served if it was consistent on the whole page.
     - About is on the main page and not separated.
